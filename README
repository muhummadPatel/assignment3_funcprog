_____NOTE: Should you require any clarification, please feel free to contact me 
           at muhummad.patel@gmail.com. Thank you. :)

Description:
This assignment involved using Scheme to write a functional program to solve a
2x2x2 shperical rubiks cube. 
>The *source code* for the solution is provided in the assignment3.scm file. 
>The *answers to the theoretical questions* are provided in the 
 theoryAnswers.pdf file.
>*Unit testing* for each procedure is provided in the comments below the 
 defintion of that procedure.

Environment:
OS: Mac OSX Yosemite (v10.10.2)
Scheme interpreter and version: Gambit (v4.7.4)

Running the solution:
The solution may be run in a command-line/terminal window as follows:
>Navigate to the directory containing this file and the assignment3.scm file
>Type 'gsi' and enter to run the Gambit Scheme interpreter
>Type '(load "Assignment3.scm")' to load the code in Assignment3.scm
>Run the solveCube procedure with a state list for a shufled cube and n=0
>You should then receive a list of moves to do in order to solve the cube
